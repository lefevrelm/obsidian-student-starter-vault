The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record

[Open in Zotero](zotero://select/items/@perryEnchantmentArchaeologicalRecord2019)


### Summary

When we frame archaeological research within a 'crisis mode' of engagement, we inadvertently shut down all that is 'enchanting' about the work that we do. This is a by-product of the drive to professionalize archaeology in the 60s and 70s. However, the thing that makes archaeology a powerful force in the world is the way that it can enchant us - but by discounting enchantment, we leave the field open for pseudo-archaeology and similar. But even more important, by being open to enchantment, and  to wonder, also can foster an ethics of care and generosity and make archaeological research a powerful force for change in a community. From the abstract: "an enchantment-led approach is imperative for achieving a truly socially-beneficial archaeological discipline."

### Own thoughts
The 'crisis-model' has permeated thinking about archaeology both in crm and academic contexts, and makes the funding argument that much harder (when balanced against other 'crises'.)
