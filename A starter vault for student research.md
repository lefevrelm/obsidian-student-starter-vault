workflow
see [[On Taking Notes]]

writing an essay
- have a fresh note in a pinned pane (maybe even keep in a 'writing' folder). search open in another pane. use journey plugin, queries, graph view, to surface interesting and relevant material. embed in the fresh note atomic thoughts from the other. fill in the blanks around them

workbench
- use this to gather notes together for whatever project? don't know how to use it
