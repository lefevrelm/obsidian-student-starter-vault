# A starter vault for students' academic research

Core plugins
- outgoing links
- daily notes
- templates
- audio recorder maybe? haven't tried it yet

Necessary community plugins
- templater with hypothesis extraction
- sliding panes - nice arrangement, look
- kanban
- citation from bib from zotero
- note refactor
- data view? don't really know how to use it
- journey - for finding paths through your notes


In Zotero:
- zoteromdnotes 
- betterbibtex

workflow
- reading note for each book, article, resource. functions as an overview note. should have a template for different kinds so that consistency maintained, same info each time. folder for these.
- observations folder - atomic notes: one thought, one note. insert the citation. paraphrase the idea. same metadata each time. any questions the note raises, have some sort of way of indicating that - this is something the data view could find?
- gardening phase. read notes; search for things that could connect. have the backlinks, outgoing links thing turned on. add links as appropriate. The outgoing links panel, when open, will identify phrases in your note and places elsewhere in your vault with the same text, with option to turn that into a link. poof!
- daily note for thoughts and ideas and scratch stuff. come back to this later.
- project management folder - keep kanban boards here. demo is 'to do', 'doing', 'done'
	- if dataview installed, maybe notes with the various kinds of queries could go there

writing an essay
- have a fresh note in a pinned pane (maybe even keep in a 'writing' folder). search open in another pane. use journey plugin, queries, graph view, to surface interesting and relevant material. embed in the fresh note atomic thoughts from the other. fill in the blanks around them

workbench
- use this to gather notes together for whatever project? don't know how to use it

still looking for
- some kind of related notes plugin or simple workflow, where 'similarity' is from td-idf or similar. Can do it in python on the folder itself, but it'd be nice to have this in obsidian itself
